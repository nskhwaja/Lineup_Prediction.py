# Lineup_Predictor_Model.py
basic script updated to this past lineup (2019). 
-Developed a Python Script using Pandas to count the number of appearances of artists performing at Electric Daisy Carnival (Las Vegas) from 2015 through 2019. From there I took the results and imported the results into Tableau to create visualizations.

- Currently working on condition statements to increase accuracy and performance.
Used https://www.reddit.com/r/electricdaisycarnival/comments/amlt6o/last_four_lineups_from_edc_ordered_by_of/ Pandas script as a baseline before adding in updated timeline and criteria.
Adding in statements tracking artists who have played at events run by Insomniac Events (Electric Forest, Countdown NYE, Beyond Wonderland, ETC.) to find patterns in artists who reoccure throughout the year, leading up to EDC Las Vegas.
Also looking to find trends of artists who gain bigger slots/headlining times throughout the year among different festivals and events.
